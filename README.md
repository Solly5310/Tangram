### Task One

Check that each piece is convex, and if it represents a polygon with n sides (n â‰¥ 3) then the representation consists
of an enumeration of the n vertices, either clockwise or anticlockwise. 

### Task Two

Check whether the sets of pieces represented in two .xml files are identical, allowing for pieces to
be flipped over horizontally, flipped over vertically, and rotated by 90 degrees. 

### Task Three

in another .xml file.
